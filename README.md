# Object-Oriented Programming Assignment

## Description

This project demonstrates fundamental **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python.
It includes **class creation, constructors, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism** through practical examples.

---

## 📝 Assignment Tasks

### **Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class**

* Created a `Smartphone` class with:

  * Attributes (brand, model, battery, etc.)
  * Methods (make\_call, charge, etc.)
* Implemented **encapsulation** using private attributes and getters/setters.
* Added **inheritance** by creating a `GamingPhone` subclass that extends `Smartphone`.

---

### **Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge**

* Implemented multiple classes (`Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`) with the same method **`move()`**.
* Each class defines `move()` differently:

  * 🚗 Car → *"Driving"*
  * ✈️ Plane → *"Flying"*
  * 🚤 Boat → *"Sailing"*
* Demonstrates **polymorphism** by treating different objects in a uniform way.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Python 🐍
* OOP concepts: Class, Object, Constructor, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/oop-assignment.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder:

   ```bash
   cd oop-assignment
   ```
3. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

* Designed custom classes with attributes and methods.
* Applied **encapsulation** to protect data.
* Used **inheritance** to extend functionality.
* Demonstrated **polymorphism** with shared method names but unique implementations.
